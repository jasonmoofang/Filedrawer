File Drawer
===========

This is a simple plasmoid that sits on your panel and, on click, simply displays the file contents of a configurable folder in a drag-scrollable "drawer".

Scratches the itch of the default folderview plasmoid NOT being sanely operate-able with a touch screen.

Modified from the "Places Widget" plasmoid (https://github.com/dfaust/plasma-applet-places-widget).

To install:

 * Clone/download to a local folder/Filedrawer

 * Run plasmapkg2 --install localfolder/Filedrawer
